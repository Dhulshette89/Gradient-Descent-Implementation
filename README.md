# Gradient-Descent-Implementation
• Description of Problem - Write a program to predict housing price vs size using batch gradient descent.  

• Description of your Solution -
Implemented batch gradient descent to predict housing price vs size. Tried different learning rates, 
with which the number of iterations got changed.
The final values of w0 and w1 are approximately similar with each learning rate.
Below are the observations of learning rates and respective iterations:

Learning Rate			Iterations		  W0	             W1
0.1				   2730	    		-9856.3           2.6906e+005      
0.15				   1866			-9867.0		  2.6907e+005		
0.17				   1659			-9870.0           2.6908e+005
0.2				   1424			-9873.5           2.6908e+005
0.3				    972			-9881.3	          2.6909e+005
